# Easy Eats
I made this API to provide a bunch of endpoints to easily manage a restaurant reservations.<br/>
Soon i will try to make an Angular project that will provide an frendly and simple interface for this API.


## What I will do with this project

This is an old project made by me almost an year ago, at that moment I was learning about Clean Architecture.

**Now** I wanna to improve this project, to make them respect Clean Architecture dependency rule and to apply some Domain-Driven Design Principles.

The old version of this project can be found on "old_project" branch.
